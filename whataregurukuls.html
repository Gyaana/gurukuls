        <h1>What are Gurukuls?</h1>
        <p>Gurukuls are traditional Indian schools or educational institutions where students learn under the guidance of a guru (teacher). The concept dates back to ancient times in India and is deeply rooted in the countryâ€™s cultural and educational history. Unlike modern schools, gurukuls were often located in natural settings, such as forests or secluded areas, providing a peaceful environment for learning.</p>

        <p>In a gurukul, students, known as shishyas, lived with their guru and received education in various subjects, including scriptures, philosophy, mathematics, and the arts. The education was holistic, focusing not only on academic learning but also on character development and spiritual growth.</p>

        <p>The guru-student relationship was central to the gurukul system. The guru provided personalized instruction and mentorship, guiding students not just in academic subjects but also in ethical and moral values. This relationship was built on mutual respect, trust, and a deep commitment to learning.</p>

        <p>Gurukuls played a significant role in preserving and transmitting ancient knowledge and cultural traditions. Though the traditional gurukul system has evolved over time, its impact on Indian education and culture remains profound.</p>
